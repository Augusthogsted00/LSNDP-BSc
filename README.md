### Optimal Maritime Connectivity | Algorithmic Modeling of Liner Shipping Networks

This project proposes a method for solving of the Liner Shipping Network Design Problem (LSNDP). The LSNDP presents intricate challenges in optimizing shipping routes and the flow of cargo. This approach employs a two-stage methodology, comprising service-first and flow-second algorithms. The service-first algorithm involves a simulated annealing metaheuristic to find a global extrema in the solution space of the service design. The flow-second algorithm
